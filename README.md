# Webex-Teams-ChatGPT-Chatbot
Here is an example of a simple Webex Teams chatbot written in Node.js that queries the ChatGPT API on demand (Written by ChatGPT)

This chatbot uses the Express.js framework to handle incoming webhooks from Webex Teams, and the axios library to make API calls to both the ChatGPT and the Webex Teams APIs. When a new message is received in a Webex Teams room, the chatbot will use the text of the message as the prompt for a ChatGPT API call. Once a response is received from ChatGPT, the chatbot will post the response as a new message in the same Webex Teams room.

You'll need to replace your_bot_id with your Webex Teams bot's ID and your_access_token with your Webex Teams API access token.

This is just a skeleton to start with, you can modify it as per your requirement.
